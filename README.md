# Web-Based Project Recommender System - Fall 2020 Honours Project
---

### Background

* For the Fall 2020 semester, I will be working on my computer science honours project under the supervision of Dr. Dave McKenney at Carleton University. This repository is where I will be building the project.
* The goal of this project is to implement a web-based project recommender system that serves as a space for people to network with and recruit people to work on various side projects. It will allow individuals who have an interest in developing a side project, but need more expertise in other technologies or application domains, to find people with those skills that could be recruited to contribute to the side project.

### Install/Launch

* To run the server, simply move to the `server` directory and install all dependencies by running `yarn install`. You can then run launch the server by running `yarn start`.
* Launching the client involves the same steps, just in the `client` directory instead.
